When I’m not working, I immerse myself in a variety of activities. I have a passion for singing and performing on stage, especially musical numbers. 
Check out my performance of "The Music of the Night" from The Phantom of the Opera, which won me the best performer of the semester at an open mic session.<br> 
<br>
I’m also deeply into sports. I love playing soccer and always formed intramural teams during my grad student years. I’m a big Tottenham fan. 
Badminton is another sport I enjoy, and I was the runner-up in the national collegiate tournament during my prime!<br>
<br>
On clear nights, I just stay outside, watching sky looking for cool objects, bursting my passion for astronomy, which started in middle school. 
My team won first place in the national astronomical observation competition, and I was able to buy my own telescope with that prize!<br>

I was born and raised in Daejeon, a city in Korea known for its quiet and peaceful atmosphere. 
So, when people ask me about West Lafayette, I always tell them it’s a great place to live, with plenty of fun activities to enjoy. 
As a big Purdue fan, I've attended almost all the basketball, football, and volleyball games. BOILER UP! 
While I appreciate a calm environment, I also love the vibrant city vibe, having spent my college years in Seoul, the largest and busiest city in Korea.<br>
<br>
Despite spending most of my life in Korea, I’m fluent in four languages: Korean, English, Spanish, and Japanese. 
I attended a foreign language high school, majoring in Spanish and learning Japanese as my second language. 
One of my proudest moments was leading my little brother on the Camino de Santiago, relying entirely on my Spanish skills. <br>
