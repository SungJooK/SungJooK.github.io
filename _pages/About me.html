I enjoy a wide variety of activities when I'm not working! In particular, I love singing (especially musical numbers) and performing on a stage (below clip is me at the open mic session winning the best performer of the semester!).
I also love playing sports and enjoy playing soccer (always played for the intramural creating our grad student team!) and badminton (won the runner up in the national collegiate tournament on my prime!) as often as I can. 
I also enjoy observing deep sky continuing my passion in astronomy since middle school (my team won the first place in the national astronomical observation competition!).<br>

I was born and raised in Daejeon, a city in Korea known for a very quite and peaceful town. People ask me about West Lafayette, I always tell them it is a great place to live in, and you can always find fun stuffs to do. <br>
Especially, as a big Purdue fan and college sports, I have been to almost all the basketball, football and volleyball games. BOILER UP!<br>
That does not mean I only love quite and calm atmosphere. I spent my college years in Seoul, the largest and busiest city in the country. Of course I love vibrant city vibe as well!<br>
<br>
I also speak 4 languages. Korean, English, Spanish, and Japanese. I majored Spanish from my high school and was able to walk Camino de Santiago leading my little brother all by my Spanish skills! <br>
