I enjoy a wide variety of activities when I'm not working! 
In particular, I love singing and performing on a stage (below clip is me at the open mic session winning the best performer of the semester!), playing soccer (always played for the intramural creating our grad student team!), and playing badminton as often as I can. 
I also enjoy observing deep sky continuing my passion in astronomy since middle school.

I was born and raised in Daejeon, a city in Korea known for a very quite and peaceful town. People ask me about West Lafayette, I always tell them it is a great place to live in, and you can always find fun stuffs to do. 
Especially, as a Purdue fan, I have been to almost all the basketball, football and volleyball games. BOILER UP!
That does not mean I only love quite and calm atmosphere. I spent my college years in Seoul, the largest and busiest city in the country. Of course I love vibrant city vibe as well!

I also speak 4 languages. Korean, English, Spanish, and Japanese. I majored Spanish from my high school and was able to go Camino de Santiago leading my little brother all by my Spanish skills! 
Also, due to geographic proximity, I was lucky enough to travel extensively around Asian countries with my family.
